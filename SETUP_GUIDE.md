```

### Step 2: Start Backend Server

}
```

### File Storage

## 🔧 Configuration

### Environment Variables (backend/.env)

```env
PORT=3001
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/ecoquest
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key_here
NODE_ENV=development
```

### Frontend API Configuration

The frontend is configured to connect to `http://localhost:3001/api`

## 🚨 Important Notes

1. **MongoDB Connection**: Make sure MongoDB is running before starting the backend
2. **File Permissions**: Ensure the backend has write permissions for the uploads directory
3. **CORS**: Backend is configured to allow requests from frontend
4. **Production**: For production, consider using cloud storage (AWS S3, Cloudinary) instead of local file storage

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Backend won't start

- Check if MongoDB is running
- Verify port 3001 is available
- Check environment variables

### Images won't upload

- Check file size (must be < 5MB)
- Verify file type (only images allowed)
- Ensure uploads directory exists

### Frontend can't connect to backend

- Verify backend is running on port 3001
- Check browser console for CORS errors
- Ensure API_BASE_URL is correct in frontend

## 🎯 Next Steps

Your community wall is now fully functional! Users can:

- Upload images of their eco-actions
- Get points based on action category
- Like and comment on posts
- View a beautiful community wall

The system is ready for production deployment with proper environment configuration and cloud storage integration.
